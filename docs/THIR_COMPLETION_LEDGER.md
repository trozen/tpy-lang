# THIR Migration Completion Ledger

The **deletion roadmap** for the THIR codegen migration: the single place that
answers *"what stands between us and retiring the AST body/form codegen path, and
what is the status of each piece."*

Companion docs, different jobs:
- `IR_DESIGN.md` -- the design + the per-increment landing log + the F1->F-final
  rung ladder (what *has* landed).
- `THIR_FORM_INVENTORY.md` -- the form-dispatch spec (the borrow/storage machinery
  THIR must subsume).
- **This ledger** -- the completion/deletion tracker (what is *left* and what gates
  each deletion). **Sequence against this, not against routing %.**

## Why this exists

We have been sequencing by **routing ROI** (highest-value cells first). That is
right for *validation* -- it put F1/F2 under the whole-corpus byte-diff over real
code early. But ROI-sequencing **structurally diverges from completion**: the goal
is not "route N% of bodies," it is "delete the AST body/form codegen," and the two
part ways exactly in the low-ROI tail. "Circle back later" does not happen on its
own. This ledger keeps the tail visible and the end-state in view.

The real done-signal is per-component **deletion**, not routing count. Routing % is
a proxy that overstates progress in the tail.

## North star and scope

**End state (this ledger's scope):** THIR is the codegen input for the
function / method / constructor **body + member-init-list** surface, and the AST
body/form codegen is deleted -- the F-final criterion in `IR_DESIGN.md`: *"the gate
excludes nothing form-related and the AST form-codegen is retired."*

**In scope:** body / expression / statement emission + the ctor MIL, across all
`(callable-kind x form x statement-shape)` cells.

**Out of scope (boundary -- so this map is not mistaken for "all of codegen"):**
- **Signatures** (params / return types) -- stay on the AST path (the M1 precedent;
  only bodies/MIL route). Whether signatures ever move to THIR is an open question,
  not part of the body migration.
- **Structural emission** -- record layout, protocol / enum / module-init /
  extension-glue. Not part of the THIR body migration.
- **MIR** -- ownership / move-optimization / loan-checking is a separate later
  stage (see the `IR_DESIGN.md` Status table); THIR completion is a prerequisite,
  not part of it.

## The completion model

THIR body coverage is a matrix of three axes; a body/MIL routes only when **every**
cell it touches is admitted:

- **Callable kind:** free function / instance method / constructor /
  static-property-dunder method / generic-record method / nested-record method.
- **Form / type-family** (the form ladder): scalar / record / Optional / tuple /
  union / generic-slot / str-bytes-view.
- **Statement & expression shape:** straight-line var-decl / assign / return /
  if-elif-else / while / range-for / aug-assign / for-over-container (value-scalar
  incr 30, record-element incr 31) / expression statements (print + bare free-function
  call, incr 32) / container method-calls (list/dict scalar slice, stmt + value
  position, incr 33) / container-literal locals (list/Array/dict/set scalar
  elements, incr 34) / logical and-or-not + inline chained compares (bool slice,
  incr 36) **(covered)** vs match / with / try-except / for-over-container
  (generators / tuple-unpack / dict-value) / async-await / yield / comprehension /
  break-continue / del-global-raise-assert **(not)**.

A **deferred cell** is one `(kind x form x shape)` the eligibility gate rejects.
Two kinds, treated oppositely:

- **Self-contained** -- needs only work in its own frontier (e.g. ctor non-init
  bodies, ctor inheritance). *Discipline: finish per-frontier before moving on --
  do not leave these scattered.*
- **Cross-axis-blocked** -- needs a shared rung (e.g. a `tuple` *field* needs the
  F3 form rung). *Parked against that rung; closes for every callable frontier at
  once when the rung lands. Tracked here, not forgotten.*

## Deletion targets (AST component -> gate -> status)

The AST body/form codegen retires component-by-component as its cells fill. Each
deletion is the concrete milestone that forces its tail closed.

| AST component to delete | Deletion gate (cells that must route) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Ctor MIL emit** -- `records.py` `_extract_field_inits` / `_extract_base_inits` / `_get_non_init_stmts` + the inline ` : f(v)... {}` write | every ctor MIL field cell + body: scalar (M3a), record/Optional copy+move (M3b), ctor-call / param-field-read sources + own-optional params (M3b-rvalue), docstring/`pass` trivia body (M3c-trivia), non-init body + demotion (M3c-demotion), inheritance -- single + multi base + inherited-field writes (M3d), and str/list/dict/tuple/union/bytes fields (F3+) + cross-module/native/generic records | **PARTIAL** -- the whole scalar/record/Optional + body + inheritance surface lands (ctor self-contained tail complete); deferred cells are cross-axis-blocked -- non-record demoted-field-writes + non-record fields (F3+) + native/generic records |
| **Body statement + expression emit** -- `statements.py` `gen_body` per-statement path + `expressions.py` `gen_expr`, for routed callables | every statement shape + expression form across every callable kind | **PARTIAL** -- straight-line shapes over the F1/F2 + scalar/bool/double-float + str-value (F6 S1) slice, incl. logical/chained-compare exprs and scalar type-constructor calls |
| **Form / conversion machinery** -- `context.py` `convert` + `CppForm`/`FormValue`, the ~12 detection predicates + ~22 local side-sets + the `RefType` wrapper (see `THIR_FORM_INVENTORY.md`) | **F-final**: the `Form` tag + `THIRFormConvert` subsume all form dispatch | **PARTIAL** -- F1/F2 forms carried + F3 tuple read/write + the F6 str view->owned convert (S1); F4/F5, the F6 tail (S2-S6), and RefType removal pending |

These interlock: deleting `gen_body`/`gen_expr` requires the form machinery gone
(F-final) and every statement shape routed. The **ctor MIL emit is the first
independently-deletable sub-component** -- it dies once ctor cells route (still
gated on F3+ for non-record fields).

## Deferred-cell registry

The map; the linked `TODO.md` cells carry the per-cell detail. Status: DONE /
deferred (self-contained) / blocked-on-`<rung>`.

### Callable-kind axis (M) -- `TODO.md` "method frontier" + "form rung F1/F2" cells
- Free functions: **DONE** (incl. readonly). Instance methods: **DONE** (M1/M2).
- Constructors: M3a scalar **DONE**; M3b record/Optional copy **DONE** + move
  **DONE** + rvalue (ctor-call / param field-read sources + own-optional params +
  the `copy()`-on-Optional source) **DONE**; M3c-trivia (docstring / `pass` non-init
  bodies) **DONE**; M3c-demotion (hoist/demotion split + non-trivia body lowered via
  the shared `_body_eligible`/`_lower_stmt` machinery -- only the `chain_broken`
  cascade needed explicit reproduction; the other demote triggers were subsumed by
  the existing eligibility gate) **DONE**; M3d inheritance (single + multi same-module
  F1 base: `super().__init__` / `BaseN.__init__` -> parent-order-sorted `THIRBaseInit`s;
  direct inherited-field writes -> body via the chain-stays-alive +
  `body_written_self_fields` + `expr_reads_self_field` mirror) **DONE**. **The ctor
  self-contained tail is COMPLETE.** Remaining ctor cells are cross-axis-blocked, not
  self-contained: demoted **record**-field writes (need the record body-write rung),
  `self.<record field>` read sources (MIL-ordering-sensitive), non-trivia body
  statements outside the statement-shape slice (match / with / try / for-container /
  method calls / ...; print + bare free-function calls now route, incr 32), and
  `str`/`list`/`dict`/`tuple`/`union` MIL fields (F3+) +
  cross-module / native / generic records (their frontiers).
- Static / property / dunder-operator methods: **deferred (self-contained)** --
  separate emit paths.
- Generic-record methods (templated `self`): **blocked-on-F5** (generic-slot form).
- Nested-record methods: **deferred (self-contained)** -- the feed walks top-level
  records only.
- Non-value **call arguments** (the `gen_call_arg` coercion cascade: auto-move,
  view->owned, union/tuple lifts) + call / `copy()`-write optional sources:
  **deferred (self-contained frontier)** -- the CASCADE itself is not isolable
  and must land whole. (The no-cascade subset OUTSIDE it -- bare-name container
  args into non-Own concrete container slots, where `own is None` and no
  branch fires -- landed separately as incr 35's pass-through widening.)
- **Non-`DEFAULT`-linkage call symbols** (`@native` / `@native_c` / `@export(binding="C")`
  callees): **deferred (self-contained)** -- `_call_eligible` gates `fi.linkage ==
  DEFAULT` (incr 32), so any caller of a native/export-C free function stays on the AST
  path permanently. THIR emits a bare `name(args)`; these need the `::`-qualified
  (`qualify_native_name`) / raw extern-C symbol the AST call-emit produces. This gate is a
  correctness fix today but a **completeness blocker**: the "delete AST call codegen"
  target is unreachable until THIR learns to emit qualified/extern-C call symbols.

### Form ladder (F) -- `IR_DESIGN.md` rung ladder + `THIR_FORM_INVENTORY.md`
- F1 (record locals + Optional read), F2 (reseatable pointer-locals + Optional
  write/return + move): **DONE**.
- F3 tuples: **PARTIAL** (increments 22-24) -- storage->borrow read
  (`tuple_to_pointer`: borrow-form tuple return + storage-tuple `auto&&` alias locals)
  + borrow->storage write (`tuple_to_storage`, tuple-field write off a borrow tuple
  param) DONE for pointer-repr tuples of scalar / F1-record / `Optional[F1-record]`
  elements. Value-result + record + Optional element subscript reads landed via the
  statement-shape axis (increments 25-27, the tuple-READ frontier; see below). **Deferred
  (blocked-on later F3 cells / the statement-shape axis):** storage-Name alias sources,
  reassignable BORROW_TUPLE / OPTIONAL_BORROW_TUPLE, the
  `tuple_to_storage_move` `Own[tuple]` move arm, loop-var / unpack sources,
  tuple-literal MIL construction. **Note:** further F3 form cells gain little routing
  until more of the statement-shape axis (the remaining subscript cells, for-loops,
  tuple-unpack) lands -- most corpus tuples are accessed that way.
- F4 unions (`to_ptr_variant`/`to_value_variant`), F5 generic-slot,
  F-final (RefType removal + retirement): **not started.**
- F6 str/bytes view-split: **OPENED (S1 str values; S2 f-strings DONE, incr 39;
  S3 concat/`+=` DONE, incr 40; S4 subscript/slice/iteration DONE, incr 41)**
  -- S1: str/StrView params,
  literal-init locals (PendingStrType resolved through ViewVarInfo at lowering),
  print args, comparisons, `len(s)`, owned-str returns, same-type call args; the
  view->owned copy is an explicit `THIRFormConvert` (str BORROW -> STORAGE,
  `std::string(x)`). **S2 f-strings DONE (increment 39, `THIRFString`)**: the
  `_gen_fstring` mirror -- all-literal `std::string("...")` (incl. the
  embedded-NUL explicit-length arm), interpolated `std::format` / NUL `vformat`,
  brace escaping, per-arg wrap templates carried on the node (str-family/
  str-literal bare, bool `bool_to_str`, double + bare-float-literal
  `float_to_str`, int8 `static_cast<int>`, IntLiteral resolved through the
  default int); the owned (STORAGE) result composes into every S1 sink (decl
  init, return, print/call arg, compare operand). S2-deferred rows (gate-
  rejected): `!r`/`!s` conversions, format specs, BigInt `.to_string()`, enum/
  Float32 `static_cast`, user/union `__str__`, `_container_to_str` containers,
  Char. S4: str subscript `s[i]` -> Char (the checked
  `::tpy::__getitem__` / bounds-safe operator[] container emit verbatim),
  non-stepped slices `s[a:b]` -> `::tpy::str_slice` view results (`THIRStrSlice`,
  BORROW, view sinks only -- an owned sink arrives as a `strview_to_str`
  TpyCoerce, the deferred coercion cell), `for c in s` Char loop vars (str/
  StrView NativeIterable[Char], incl. pending-resolved str locals), Char
  params/returns/prints/call-args, char-literal compare operands
  (`THIRCharLiteral` `'x'`, the `_comparison_targets` char-arm mirror;
  Char-targeted literals at decl/reassign/return stay AST), and the reassigned
  StrView-param widening (the reject now keys on the exact AST trigger,
  `param_needs_copy_for_reassign`). S3: same-type `a + b` (the resolved
  `__add__` template; an owned STORAGE `String` result feeding the S1 sinks,
  plus String-typed locals / len / print args / the identity `string_to_str`
  coercion) and the in-place appends -- str `+=` statements and the
  `x = x + y` self-append peephole -- both lowering to `THIRStrAppend`
  (`t += v;`; NB scalar aug-assign lowers as the `THIRAssign`+`THIRBinOp`
  desugar -- if a general aug-assign node ever lands, fold this in rather
  than growing two parallel aug-assign systems); Char operands of concat,
  `str * n`, String params/returns, and
  aug-assigned str PARAMS stay AST (the last is a pre-existing AST miscompile,
  see BUGS.md). Remaining S-cells: S4 leftovers (stepped slices via
  `::tpy::Slice`, slice-typed variable indices `s[sl]`, Char-targeted literal
  decl/reassign/return renders, Char record fields, non-name
  receivers/iterables),
  S5 dict[str]/container-of-str keys+elements (static-storage literal pinning,
  owned-slot wraps), S6 bytes (explicit `bytes_copy` wraps, `BytesPrinter`,
  non-view-safe literals; the S1 plumbing is family-generic, but emit.py's bytes
  convert arm is UNREACHABLE until S6 -- the cell must validate it under the
  byte-diff, not inherit it as verified), plus: cross-type
  str-family coercions (str<->StrView<->String -- position-dependent identity vs
  materialization), reassigned owned-str params (owned-copy prologue),
  multi-overload
  callees with str-literal args (`_wants_str_literal_pin`), `String`/
  `Literal[str]` bindings, `bytearray` (a reference type, different axis).
- F2 carry-over deferred cells (container locals, cross-module/native/generic
  records, subscript sources, narrowing-needed `->` deref, name-alias/REF_ALIAS
  reseat sources): **blocked-on-F3+** or the relevant frontier; see the F1/F2 TODO
  cell (items C-G).

### Statement / expression shapes -- **AXIS OPENED (increment 25), STILL MOSTLY UNCOVERED**
The form ladder and callable axis are tracked; the statement-shape axis was the
untracked gap and is now being enumerated + driven.
Routed so far: var-decl / assign / return / if-elif-else / while / range-for /
aug-assign, plus the no-op trivia `pass` / docstring (M3c-trivia, `THIRNoOpStmt`),
**value-result tuple subscript reads** (`t[N]` -> `std::get<N>(t)`, `THIRSubscript`,
increment 25 -- the first deliberate cell of this axis; admits value-scalar tuple params
to carry routing), **record-element subscript reads** (`t[N].field` off a plain-record
element -> `std::get<N>(t)->field` / `.field` per the element-form arrow mirror, increment
26), and **Optional[record]-element member access** (`t[N].field` on an unproven Optional
-> `deref_check(<T*>).field`, a `deref_check` flag on `THIRFieldAccess` + the storage-source
`optional_to_ptr` lift, increment 27), and the **write position** (`t[N].field = / +=
<scalar>` off a record element -> `std::get<N>(t)->field = ...`, the position-neutral
`_field_over_subscript_ok` added to the scalar-field-write + aug-assign gates, increment 28).
**The tuple-subscript FAMILY is COMPLETE** (record-element reads + writes; value + Optional
reads). And **container subscript READS** (`c[i]` off a `list[scalar]` / `dict[fixed-int,
scalar]` param -> `::tpy::__getitem__(c, i)` / bounds-safe `c[static_cast<std::size_t>(i)]`,
increment 29) -- this is where `THIRSubscript` reaches its canonical shape (`index: THIRExpr`
+ `bounds_safe`, emit dispatched tuple-vs-container on receiver type). Subscript follow-ons
still on AST: Optional-field / tuple-field writes THROUGH a tuple subscript (`t[N].opt =
None` -- the `_f2b`/`_f1_tuple` write gates still name-only); and, for containers -- BigInt /
view-typed keys+indices (the `.to_fixed_check` narrow / static-storage literals), `dict[K,
Any]` (`any_cast_or_panic`), record/Optional/container *element* results (borrow form),
narrowed-`Optional` receivers, non-name receivers (container-literal-init locals landed
incr 34), and the whole container-write side (`c[i] = v` / `+=` / `del` / slices). And **container iteration**
(`for x in <NativeIterable>:` over a value-scalar element -> the begin/end loop, a new
`THIRForEach`; + the `len(c)` builtin via a `native_name` on `THIRCall`; increment 30) --
`range(len(c))` now routes, lighting up the bounds-safe subscript branch. The
**record-element loop** (`for x in <list[record]>:` -- the loop var a borrow alias `auto&&` /
`const auto&`, field access `.field` exactly like a record param; increment 31) completes the
for-each family; it needed only sema's `const_loop_var` threaded onto `THIRForEach` (the emit
already produced the record binding) + a `_container_record_iter` param predicate. **KEY
FINDING (value-scalar shape):** completing the loop *shape* gains little routing (5120 -> 5128
bodies) because loop *bodies* overwhelmingly use `print` / `.append` (371 of 393 for-loop
files); the routing bottleneck is the common **body constructs** (`print`, method calls like
`.append`, the `Int32(0)` constructor-init), not the statement shapes -- those are the next
high-leverage unblocks. (The record-element cell was the exception: +48 bodies, 5128 -> 5176,
because admitting the `list[record]` param unblocks whole record-iterating functions.)
**`print` landed (incr 32): +453 bodies (5176 -> 5629) -- the biggest single-cell gain**, since
print gated a huge tail of small functions (main + helpers); this confirms the body-construct
model. **Container method-calls landed (incr 33, `THIRMethodCall`): +11 bodies (5629 -> 5640)**
-- the shape is covered (all three `gen_call_from_fi` emit arms -- `@cpp_template`, `@native`
free function, plain/renamed member -- in statement and value position, on the admitted
list/dict param family), but the modest gain exposed the next co-blocker: most `.append` sites
sit on container-*literal locals* (`xs = [...]` / `xs = []`), whose var-decls don't route, so
those functions stay AST regardless. **Container-literal locals landed (incr 34,
`THIRContainerLiteral`): +38 bodies (5640 -> 5678)** -- list (vector AND the read-only
Array demotion) / dict / set literal decls route with scalar elements, and the local enters
`declared` so the param-receiver shapes (method calls / subscripts / len / iteration) light
up on locals; `_container_scalar_read` + the len gate widened to `Array[scalar, N]`.
Rejected-by-design (aliasing/emit fidelity): REASSIGNED container-literal locals (the AST
makes them pointer-locals -- `a = b` rebinds the alias; a value decl would silently copy)
and fixed-target binops with two IntLiteral-typed non-name operands (the AST's no-paren
literal-operand branch, position-dependent). The measured next co-blockers: **container
locals as call args** (`f(xs)` -- the borrow-ref pass looks like another gen_call_arg
pass-through for non-Own container params; keeps `main()`-shaped callers on AST), the
`Int32(0)` constructor-init, and the str/BigInt/f-string print args. Literal-locals cells
still deferred: `[0] * n` (`TpyListRepeat`), nested container literals, str/record/Optional
elements, empty-`Array` literals, container reassignment + aliasing (`ys = xs`), subscript
writes (`xs[i] = v`). **Container call args landed (incr 35,
`_container_pass_through_arg`): +11 bodies (5678 -> 5689)** -- a bare-name arg with a
builtin-container binding into a NON-Own concrete container param passes through as the bare
name in `_call_eligible` + `_method_call_eligible` (no new node/emit); `Own[container]`
(auto-move), `Span` (as_mut_span conversion), and protocol (`Iterable`) slots stay AST.
**F-strings landed (incr 39, `THIRFString`): +27 bodies (22165 -> 22192 solo)** --
the last measured co-blocker for `main()`-shaped functions (str VALUES landed with
the F6 S1 cell, the `Int32(0)` constructor-init with incr 37); scope + deferred
rows in the F6 row above. The modest gain reflects f-strings co-occurring with
other ineligible constructs (bare numeric-literal call args, containers) in most
corpus `main()`s. **Str concat/`+=` landed (incr 40, `THIRStrAppend`): +21 bodies
(22165 -> 22186 solo)** -- same modest-gain pattern (concat co-occurs with
still-deferred shapes); scope in the F6 row. **Str subscript/slice/iteration
landed (incr 41, `THIRStrSlice`/`THIRCharLiteral`): +331 bodies (22165 -> 22496
solo)** -- Char values enter the slice; scope in the F6 row. Increments 39-41
were parallel cells integrated sequentially; the INTEGRATED tally on the merged
tree is **22545 bodies / 3271 cases** (+380 over the 22165 base -- the cells'
solo gains plus cross-cell composition).
**Logical and/or/not + inline chained
compares landed (incr 36, `THIRUnaryNot`): +2435 bodies (5689 -> 8124) -- the biggest
single-cell gain to date** (conditions gate everything); bool-result `&&`/`||` over bool
operands and the chained-compare pair fold reuse `THIRBinOp`'s bare-operator arm. Deferred
by design: value-semantics `and`/`or` (non-bool result -> `_gen_logical_value` temp+ternary),
non-bool truthiness operands (incl. `not <int>`), the statement-expr chained arm (a
non-`_is_simple_expr` intermediate binds `_cmp` temps), bool-literal conditions
(dead-branch elimination). The incr-36 byte-diff also exposed and closed a latent compare
gap: the rb=None derived-comparison arm admitted RECORD operands (`not (self <= other)` from
`@total_ordering` -- the AST derefs `(*this)`); compare operands are now pinned to resolved
scalars (widened to the str slice when the F6 S1 cell merged: str operands emit the same
bare/templated compare on both paths). **Scalar type-constructor calls landed
(incr 37, `cpp_template` on `THIRCall`): +94 bodies (5689 -> 5783)** -- `Int32(0)` /
`UInt32(x)` / `Int64(a + b)` / `Float64(1.5)` / `bool(n)` / zero-arg ctors route in every
covered expression position; sema's fully-substituted `__init__` template expands
receiver-less at emit, gated to positional-only templates + eligible-scalar result/args.
Rejected-by-design (AST): str/bytes/BigInt/Float32/Char conversions (incl. `float("nan")`'s
constexpr fold), enum / borrowing-view ctors, out-of-int32-range literals (the AST's
`static_cast` wrap), unary-minus args. Method-call cells still deferred: `set`/`Span`/`Array` receivers (params not
admitted), str/bytes args (owned-copy conversion), record / `Own[record]` args (ownership
boundary -- part of the `gen_call_arg` frontier below), non-name receivers
(`self.items.append(...)`), user-record method receivers + same-module `self.helper()` call
sites (the record emit path: temps / TypeParamRef handling -- a bigger separate frontier),
consuming receivers, generic `inferred_type_args` methods, negative-literal args (unary
minus, a pre-existing expression-slice boundary).
Deferred container-iteration cells: `dict[int, record]` key iteration (param not admitted --
its value read is a record borrow), `set`/`Span`/`Array` containers (params not yet admitted),
str/bytes-key dicts, `dict.items()`/tuple-unpack, non-name iterables (a field/subscript/call/
literal receiver; only a bare declared name routes today), generators / user iterators (the
`__iter__`/`__next__` fallback), hoisted loop vars, `for/else`, consuming/enum iteration. (Audit-note: the gate keys
`is_native_iterable` off the use-site type -- re-check it when narrowed-`Optional` containers
land, since a narrowed value-repr Optional could then reach it.) Beyond subscript/iteration (separate frontiers): value-tuple locals, standalone
record/Optional-element binds / borrow returns, tuple-unpack. **Test-coverage follow-on:** the storage-tuple-alias receiver form (`a = h.pair;
a[N].field` read/write) is covered only by unit byte-diff, not a build+run corpus case -- add
one (the aliasing fn must stay THIR-routable, i.e. no `print()` inside it) for exec/cpy
coverage of the `.`-access + `optional_to_ptr` alias paths.
Uncovered shapes include: `match`, `with`, `try`/`except`/`finally`,
`for`-over-container (value-scalar landed incr 30, record-element incr 31; generators /
tuple-unpack / dict-value remain), expression statements (print + bare call landed incr 32;
container method-calls landed incr 33 -- their deferred receiver/arg cells listed above),
`async`/`await`, `yield` / generators, comprehensions,
`break`/`continue`, `del`/`global`/`nonlocal`/`raise`/`assert`, chained
comparisons with non-simple intermediates (the statement-expr arm) and value-semantics /
non-bool-truthiness `and`/`or`/`not` (the bool slice landed incr 36). **Action:** continue
enumerating + driving these as a tracked axis before claiming `gen_body`/`gen_expr`
deletion is near.

## Sequencing discipline (the plan)

1. **Drive the form ladder (F3 -> F-final) as the spine.** Highest leverage: each
   rung unblocks form cells in *every* callable frontier at once, and F-final is the
   gate on retiring the form machinery.
2. **Finish a frontier's self-contained tail before moving on.** Opening a frontier
   commits us to closing its self-contained cells (do not leave them scattered).
3. **Park cross-axis-blocked cells against their rung** -- tracked here, closed when
   the shared rung lands.
4. **Hold per-component deletion as the real done-signal** -- late and
   form-ladder-gated, but the explicit endpoint, so high routing is never mistaken
   for completion.

## Per-cell test convention (2026-07-02)

THIR cells default to **scaffold units only** (routes/ineligible pairs for the
gate + a targeted `test_byte_identical` per new emit arm -- the byte-diff in
miniature). A dedicated corpus case is added ONLY when the shape occurs nowhere
in the corpus (the whole-corpus byte-diff would be vacuous for it) AND a unit
cannot express it (multi-module, exec-observable). Rationale: a THIR cell adds
no language behavior; corpus-case exec runs the AST-path binary (byte-identity
transfers its coverage to THIR), so a new case's functional/exec phases only
re-test constructs the reviewed corpus already covers. Under-routing stays
guarded by the routes-units (invisible to the byte-diff); over-routing by the
byte-diff itself.

## Maintaining this ledger

- Flip cells / update statuses when a rung lands or a deferral is discovered.
- **Planned:** extend the `--thir-codegen` non-vacuity tally to report per-component
  AST-fallback coverage (how much of each component still falls back to AST), so the
  gap to each deletion is *measured*, not estimated. Today the tally reports only
  total routed bodies/cases (22165 bodies / 3271 cases as of increment 38).
